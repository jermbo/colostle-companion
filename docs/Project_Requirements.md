# Project Requirements Document

Colostle is a tabletop role-playing game app that allows users to create characters, play through sessions, and manage their companions/NPCs. The app will provide an immersive experience for players of the Colostle tabletop RPG.

## Goals

1. **Provide an Immersive Experience**: Offer a realistic simulation of playing the tabletop RPG, including character creation, exploration phase, combat mechanics, and companion/NPC management.
2. **Simplify Character Creation**: Allow users to easily create new characters or select existing ones using a streamlined process that minimizes complexity and confusion.
3. **Streamline Session Management**: Provide an intuitive interface for navigating between different parts of the app (character creation, exploration phase, combat mechanics), making it easy for users to manage their sessions.

## Scope

1. **Character Creation**: Include features such as:
   - Customizable character profiles with attributes and skills.
   - Ability to assign equipment and inventory items to characters.
2. **Exploration Phase**: Implement a system that allows users to explore the world by drawing cards and making choices, including:
   - Card-based exploration mechanics (e.g., draw a card, decide what action to take).
   - Integration with combat mechanics for seamless transitions between exploration and combat phases.
3. **Combat Mechanics**: Include features such as:
   - Turn-based combat system that allows users to make decisions about actions and attacks.
   - Randomized enemy encounters and difficulty levels.
4. **Companion/NPC Management**: Provide a way for users to manage their companions/NPCs, including:
   - Customizable companion profiles with attributes and skills.
   - Ability to assign inventory items and equipment to companions.
