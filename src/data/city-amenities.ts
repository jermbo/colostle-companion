		description:
			"This city has a palace, and a ruler as well. This is likely a place of sumptuous architecture built out of only the most ornate Rook husks, at a high point in the city looking over everyone else. It is doubtful that a wanderer such as yourself would simply be allowed in but perhaps your story has given your character a reason to speak to the ruler? An offering would certainly help - maybe you have picked up a treasure on your adventure?",

One that isn't Ice, Rumble or Electric; but a new one-of-a-kind magical power. You can come up with what this power is and how your character can use it.",

			"Toiling away in their Mount Garages; Rooksmiths work on the mechanical parts of Rooks and convert them into vehicles or mounts to be ridden upon.\nFOR 3 TREASURES - they will build a custom mount for your character. It could be seaworthy, or landworthy and will feature some form of WEAPON based attack ability which you can choose (such as cannon, crossbow, battering ram etc.) See MOUNTED class info for fighting with MOUNT weapons.",

			"A wise and bookish individual dedicated to the difficult art of mapping the lands around the city. Cartographers rely on information from Rook Hunters as they cannot go out and collect it themselves.\nTHEY WILL PAY 2 TREASURES for a map of a new area. Take a quest from the Hunter's Guild. Draw a map of your adventure marking anything discovered from your EXPLORATION phases whilst on the quest. Return it to the Cartographer for your reward.",

The Arms dealer can find a new arm for you and help you with the ritual of attunement.\nFOR 2 TREASURES - they can provide you with a whole new arm. This can be whatever you imagine - perhaps it is coiled like a snake, or huge and thick like a tree trunk; able to lift a boulder with ease?",
